# 8086-Based-Heater-Temperature-Control-System
This project implements a heater temperature control system up to 1200°C using an 8086 Microprocessor, 8255 PPI, and an external ADC 0804. The temperature setpoint is configured via push buttons and displayed along with the actual temperature on a 7-segment display. The system was designed and simulated using Proteus with assembly code.
